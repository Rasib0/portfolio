But you clicked the about page so you probably want to know more about me, here are some things:

- I code in neovim (btw) with a basic i3, arch setup
- Personality type is ISTJ-A (Logistician apparently)
- My favourite youtuber of course is the Primeagen
- Favourite books are the basic: "Deep Work" by [Cal Newport](), "Atomic Habit" by [James Clear](), and "The name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss
- My Favourite Quote is ["It's the questions we can't answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he'll look for his own answers."]()

If you don't care about me, but just want to know what stack I used to build this blog, read below!

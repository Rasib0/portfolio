Hi, I am Rasib, a software engineer from Pakistan. I like learning shiny new things and talking about them. You can check out my resume [here](https://old.rasib.me/resume.pdf)
Since you are somehow here, here are some facts about me:

- I code in neovim (btw) with a basic i3, arch setup
- Personality type is ISTJ-A (Logistician apparently)
- My favourite youtuber is THE Primeagen
- Favourite books are the basic: "Deep Work" by [Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/), "Atomic Habit" by [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/), and "The name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss
- My Favourite Quote is ["It's the questions we can't answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he'll look for his own answers."]()

_If you don't care about me, but are curious about the stack I used to build this blog, read below!_
